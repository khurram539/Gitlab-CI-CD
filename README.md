This course will NOT make you a GitLab CI / DevOps expert

A lot of courses promise you will become an expert. Becoming an expert in any tool comes with time and hard work. It simply does not make sense to promise something like that. It will not be honest.

This is a course designed for beginners. Learning to build pipelines is a try-and-error process that can be very frustrating. You need to understand the tools you use and how GitLab can support your needs. In the end, GitLab is just a tool.

What I will try is to explain to you the basics and offer you enough practice opportunities so that you can apply what you learn easily in your own projects as well. I will show you how to build pipelines with Gitlab CI.
